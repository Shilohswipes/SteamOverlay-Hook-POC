## About Steam Overlay Hook Proof-Of-Concept (POC)
Steam Overlay Hook Proof-Of-Concept (POC) is about hooking into Steam Overlay which is the overlay you get when you launch a game with steam.
The project is written in C++ so it can be used to make projects like cheats or mods. If you have a issue injecting or something is outdated, please create a issue or a pull-request that will fix the issue!

## Updating
If something gets outdated or Steam Overlay gets updated which will probably be never, I will try to update the project as soon as possible.
