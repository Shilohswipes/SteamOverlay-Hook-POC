## About Steam Overlay Hook Proof-Of-Concept (POC)
Steam Overlay Hook Proof-Of-Concept (POC) is about hooking into Steam Overlay which is the overlay you get when you launch a game with steam.
Written in C++ so it can be used to make projects. If you have a issue injecting or somethings outdated, please create a issue or pull-request!

## Updating
If something is outdated or Steam Overlay gets updated (probably never) I will try to update it to latest version.
I will update sigs every time if it gets updated!
